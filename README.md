# How to use
Download the repository or if you prefer just the relevant executable from [Releases](https://github.com/Wrongtown/ArkSE-QOL/releases).

Ideally save that .exe in a folder of its own and run the .exe; it will create the files it needs (e.g. KB.txt) within that directory if they don't already exist. Updating to a new release won't overwrite any existing KB.txt file.

The **About** page of these applications is the best place to find up to date information on the features available.


## KeyBuddy - Valheim
Quality of Life assistance for Valheim.

* Designed to allow you to store a couple of servers (and their passwords if you desire) in a local file, and enter those for you. When I started playing Valheim there was no obvious mechanism to flag a server as your favourite, this way you can just hit Join by IP and a couple of shortcuts.

* If you add a value to [Game]Path in KB.txt (e.g. steam://rungames/892970) and the app will offer to open Valheim if Valheim is not already running.

* If you're doing some build planning etc on a local world, Ctrl+F5 will enter the devcommands and debugmode commands which are generally the first thing you need to input after opening the console (with F5).




## KeyBuddy - Ark:SE 
Cruise control for Ark: Survival Evolved

* Hit Middle Mouse Button to effectively hold down the W key. It will be over-ridden if you hit it again or if you press W yourself to take over. Now you can aim your flyer at your destination, start the journey and go get a snack.

* Hit F2 to hold down the Left Mouse Button (chopping trees, mining stone etc)

* Hit F4 to hold down the E key (for harvesting berries etc). 
** Note that if you do this while mounted up high, you will have a bad time.

Hit F11 if you'd like to input the string you provide in the KB.txt file. What string? That's up to you.



# Troubleshooting

If you're having issues, the first thing I'd suggest is to check the values in the KB.txt file. 

Consider making a copy of this file then deleting the original, then running the app to produce a fresh file.
